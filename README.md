# test-codes
Just some sample code I did recently 
We have a street with mushroom at every place, represented by a non-empty and potentially big (one hundred thousand) vector of relatively small unsigned integers (say, less than one thousand). It is given also the initial position of a picker, and its movement range. We want to maximize the number of collected mushrooms.

This problem is proposed as example in the Codility Prefix Sum section. I would argue it is not the best choice, since the prefix sum part of the problem is hidden by the complexity of the determining how the picker moves in the array. Still, I had some good fun solving it.
