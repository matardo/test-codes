# test-codes
Just some sample code.
We have a street with mushroom at every place, represented by a non-empty array of relatively small unsigned integers (say, less than one thousand). It is given also the initial position of a picker, and its movement range. We want to maximize the number of collected mushrooms. This problem is proposed as example in the Codility Prefix Sum section.
